# Reminder Bot JS

## Inspiration

After an online semester at school I realized there was a course in which I taught myself most of the material and so I often forgot to
attend my live lectures. This hurt my overall grade as attendance was counted in that class. That is why I decided to write this bot so I would never forget to attend any of my classes even if I felt that attending the lectures was unncessary.

## Description

This bot can be used in any Discord server. It will look for certain trigger words in messages. Users can add, remove, and view reminders stored in a firestore database on Google servers.
